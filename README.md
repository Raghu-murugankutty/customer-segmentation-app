### Data :  
Use the below link to download the Data Set:[here](https://github.com/pik1989/MarketSegmentation/blob/main/Clustered_Customer_Data.csv) 
### Algorithms used :  
In this dataset i've used clustering algorithm to perform segmentation.
- [K-Means Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)
### Final Model  :
I have created a Streamlit Application based on this clustering technique, taking the cuand stomer details & identifying which cluster the custoemr belongs to.
